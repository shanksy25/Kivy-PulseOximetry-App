# Kivy-PulseOximetry-App
A GUI created using the Kivy framework paired with a Python DSP algorithm to read in PPG data from the HC-05 bluetooth module through serial bluetooth communication and display the user's heart rate and oxygen saturation levels

An additional Arduino algorithm to transmit the obtained analog PPG signals from the designed circuit through the ADC of the Arduino Pro Mini microcontroller to the HC-05 module

An independent T test was conducted after comparing the device with a Samsung module and the resulting scores were 3.15 and 0.87 for the heart rate and oximetry readings respectively
